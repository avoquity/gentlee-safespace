  {
    question: "Is my conversation really private?",
    answer: "Yes. We never sell or share your words with third partiesâ€”period. Your entries live on encrypted servers purely so Gentlee can gently 'remember,' spot patterns, and serve you better. You can export or delete your data any time in Settings."
  },
  {
    question: "What plans are available and how much do they cost?",

  },
  {
    question: "Is Gentlee a replacement for therapy?",
    answer: "No. Gentlee is a compassionate companion for everyday reflection, not a substitute for professional care. Use it for gentle check-ins, perspective shifts, and habit-forming promptsâ€”but see a licensed therapist for trauma, crisis, or clinical diagnosis."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I chat in my native language?",
    answer: "Absolutely. Gentlee understands and replies in almost any languageâ€”just start typing and it will follow your lead."
  },
  {
    question: "What technology powers Gentlee?",
    answer: "Gentlee runs on OpenAI's GPT-4.1 engine, fine-tuned with evidence-based psychology prompts and our proprietary 'gentle mirror' guidance layer."
  },
  {
    question: "How does Gentlee \"remember\" me?",
    answer: "With your permission, it stores a history of past chats so it can recognise themes, track mood shifts, and offer deeper insights. We call this Personalised Memory (limited to your last 5 chats on the free plan, unlimited on Premium)."
  },
  {
    question: "What if I need immediate help?",
    answer: "If you ever feel unsafe or in crisis, please contact local emergency services or a qualified mental-health professional right away. Gentlee isn't equipped to handle emergencies."
  },
  {
    question: "What's on the roadmap?",
    answer: "Coming soon: Smart Check-Ins (AI-timed nudges when your mood drifts) and Self-Assurance on-the-go (bite-size grounding exercises for busy days). Have ideas? Add themâ€”or voteâ€”at lumi-studios.canny.io/feature-requests."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I give feedback or report a bug?",
    answer: "We're all ears. Email hellolumistudios@gmail.com and we'll reply within 24 hours on weekdays."
  },
  {
    question: "Will Gentlee judge me?",
    answer: "Never. Our goal is compassionate reflection, not advice-splaining or productivity guilt. You set the pace; Gentlee simply listens, connects dots, and hands the insight back to you."
